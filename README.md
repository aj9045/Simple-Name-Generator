### Simple Name Generator

Using ReactJS tutorial base to create a simple name generator using preselected names, both first and last, from two CSV files.

`npm install`

then

`npm start`


Why?  Because stories always need characters.

Feel free to use the names I've complied, add to the list, or replace it with your own list.


#### Uses

- Generate a random full name, which is pulling from two separate lists of first and last names by clicking the "generate" button
- Save a full name in the Saved Names list with the "save" button
- Hover over a name in your Saved names list to find a delete button to its right to delete that name
- Clear the entire Saved Names list with the "clear all" button
- While generating names, if you like the first name but not the last name, click on the the first name to hold it.  Click "generate" and it will only generate a new last name.  To release it, just click the first name again.  This works with both the first and last names.

I went on a last name adding spree, so now there are many more last names than first names.  I'll hopefully be updating the first name list soon.

I also want to point out that there are both masculine and feminine first names in the first name mix.  You've probably figured that out by now. It shall stay that way on my end.  No need to split them up.

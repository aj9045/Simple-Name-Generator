### Simple Name Generator

Using ReactJS tutorial base to create a simple name generator using preselected names, both first and last, from two CSV files.

`npm install`

then

`node server.js`


Why?  Because stories always need characters.

Feel free to use the names I've complied, add to the list, or replace it with your own list.


#### Uses

- Generate a random full name, which is pulling from two separate lists of first and last names by clicking the "generate" button
- Save a full name in the Saved Names list with the "save" button
- Hover over a name in your Saved names list to find a delete button to its right to delete that name
- Clear the entire Saved Names list with the "clear all" button
- While generating names, if you like the first name but not the last name, click on the the first name to hold it.  Click "generate" and it will only generate a new last name.  To release it, just click the first name again.  This works with both the first and last names.
